# Configuration

## identifiers

Different formatting of identifiers (e.g. class names, keyframes, CSS Vars, etc) can be configured by selecting from the following options:

- `short` identifiers are a 7+ character hash. e.g. `hnw5tz3`
- `debug` identifiers contain human readable prefixes representing the owning filename and a potential rule level debug name. e.g. `myfile_mystyle_hnw5tz3`

Each integration will set a default value based on the configuration options passed to the bundler.
