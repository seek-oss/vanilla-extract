Update the unit-less property map

The original list was borrowed from the [postcss-js parser](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-js/blob/d5127d4278c133f333f1c66f990f3552a907128e/parser.js#L5), but decided to reverse engineer an updated list from [csstype](https://github.com/frenic/csstype) for more thorough coverage.
